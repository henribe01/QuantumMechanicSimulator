## Theory

### Schrödinger's Equation

The Schrödinger's Equation is a partial differential equation that describes
how the quantum state of a physical system evolves over time.
It is defined as

````math
i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H} |\psi(t)\rangle
````

where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system. It is the sum of the
kinetic energy and the potential energy of the system.

````math
\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(\hat{x}) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x)
````

## Technologies used

- Python
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for plotting/animate the results)
- Scipy (for efficient matrix operations and solving the linear system)

## Challenges and Solutions

- Finding a starting point for the project:
    - I found two blog posts [[1](#sources)], [[2](#sources)] where the Authors
      implemented something similar. I used this as a starting point for my
      project.
- The runtime to calculate the results was too long (30s for 1000 time steps):
    1. First Problem was, that I transformed a Numpy array into a Scipy Sparse
       CSC matrix in every iteration. This was the biggest bottleneck. I
       solved this by transforming the Numpy array into a Scipy Sparse CSC
       matrix once and then using this matrix in every iteration.
       This reduced the runtime from 30s to 2.5s. (Improvement-factor: 12)
    2. The second problem was, that I used the 'sp.sparse.linalg.solve' function
       which is efficient for sparse matrices, but there is a more efficient
       algorithm for tridiagonal matrices. I transformed the matrix into a
       band matrix and solved the linear system with the '
       sp.linalg.solve_banded'.
       This reduced the runtime from 2.5s to 1s. (Improvement-factor: 2.5)
  - Both optimizations together reduced the runtime from 30s to 1s.
    (Improvement-factor: 30)
- Finding time to work on the project:
  - Due to college I had to pause the project for a few months. The good thing
    is, that in the meantime I learned a lot about computational physics 
    and numerical methods in college courses, which will definitely help me 
    to improve the project.
